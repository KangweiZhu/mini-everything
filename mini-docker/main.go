	This is the function that will be called by run(). The run will call this function if the input command is "child".
	But notice that this calling "child" procedure is done by run(), not us.
	That is, we will call go run main.go run <our command>, and the run will call itself, by using the linux symbolic link that points to the executable of the current process,
with the parameter child + <our command>
	Then we will be able to start the child process, and also set the name(hostname) of this child process.


	Question: Why we cannot done this in run()?
	Answer: Because you can put the `syscall.Sethostname([]byte("container"))` nowhere in the run() method. Either putting the code snipet before or after the code `cmd.Run()` is going to set
our root hostname to container but not our container's name
